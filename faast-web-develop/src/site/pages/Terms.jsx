              <p>WARNING: In many cases, a lost of forgotten password can result in the inability to transfer cryptocurrency!</p>

              <p>Faast does not store passwords. IF YOU LOSE YOUR PASSWORD, YOU MAY LOSE ALL ACCESS TO YOUR cryptocurrency.</p>

              <h5 className='font-weight-bold'>ELIGIBILITY</h5>
              <p>By accessing or using the Site, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old and have not previously been suspended or removed from the Site. You also represent and warrant that you are not a resident of a Restricted Location as listed below. The list of Restricted States is subject to change at any time.</p>

              <p>RESTRICTED LOCATIONS: NORTH KOREA, IRAN, CUBA, UNITED STATES, SUDAN, UNITED KINGDOM, CRIMEA, CANADA</p>

              <h5 className='font-weight-bold'>Third Parties</h5>
              <p>Faast has no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any goods or services that you may purchase or sell to or from a third party. Faast is not responsible for ensuring that a buyer or a seller you may transact with will actually complete the transaction or is authorized to do so. If you experience a problem with any goods or services purchased from, or sold to, a third party in connection with cryptocurrency transferred using the Faast services, or if you have a dispute with such third party, you must resolve the dispute directly with that third party.</p>

              <h5 className='font-weight-bold'>Cryptocurrency Protocols</h5>
              <p>Faast does not own or control the underlying software protocols which govern the operation of Digital Currencies supported on our platform. In general, the underlying protocols are open source and anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute them. By using Faast, you acknowledge and agree (i) that Faast is not responsible for operation of the underlying protocols and that Faast makes no guarantee of their functionality, security, or availability; and (ii) that the underlying protocols are subject to sudden changes in operating rules (a/k/a “forks”), and that such forks may materially affect the value, function, and/or even the name of the cryptocurrency . In the event of a fork, you agree that Faast may temporarily suspend Faast operations (with or without advance notice to you) and that Faast may, in its sole discretion, decide whether or not to support (or cease supporting) either branch of the forked protocol entirely. You acknowledge and agree that Faast assumes absolutely no responsibility whatsoever in respect of an unsupported branch of a forked protocol.</p>

              <h5 className='font-weight-bold'>Marketplace</h5>
              <p>Eligible users in certain jurisdictions may use the Faast network to conduct peer-to-peer trades of one cryptocurrency for another cryptocurrency. Faast is not a counterparty to these conversions.  Fas.st provides a marketplace to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrency. Payments are exchanged on a peer-to-peer basis between the Makers in the Faast Network and Takers in the Faast Network. Faast provides an API or "Application Program Interface" which provides cryptocurrency addresses which are generally used to convert from one cryptocurrency to another. These cryptocurrency addresses belong to Makers on the faast network. Faast takes no responsibility if a conversion does not complete as expected. Any disputes should be directed to the owner of the associated cryptocurrency address. The conversions are subject to the "conversion rate" for the given transaction, which are derived from offers posted by makers on the faast networks. "Conversion rate" means the price of a given supported Cryptocurrency amount as quoted in offers made by Maker’s and submitted to the Faast API, which may be displayed on the Faast website. The conversion rate is stated as a "Price" or as a "Rate," which is the price in terms of cryptocurrency at which you may convert a supported cryptocurrency on a cryptocurrency network. You acknowledge that the price conversion rate may not be exactly as stated on the Faast website. You agree, as a condition of using any Faast Services, to accept the conversion rate as the sole conversion metric. Faast reserves the right to delay any conversion Service transaction if it perceives a risk of fraud or illegal activity. Faast does not guarantee the availability of its Service, and the act of converting supported cryptocurrency does not result in a guarantee that you may convert your supported cryptocurrency again at a later time.</p>

              <p>You cannot cancel, reverse, or change any transaction marked as complete or pending. If Faast suspects the transaction involves (or has a high risk of involvement in) money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other type of financial crime; in response to a subpoena, court order, or other government order; if Faast reasonably suspects that the transaction is erroneous; or if Faast suspects the transaction relates to Prohibited Use or a Prohibited Business as set forth below. In such instances, Faast will reverse the transaction and we are under no obligation to allow you to reinstate a purchase or sale order at the same price or on the same terms as the cancelled transaction.</p>

              <h5 className='font-weight-bold'>Terms Specific to Maker Network Participants</h5>
              <p>The Faast Network may charge a Maker an API network access fee for continued access to the Faast Network. This fee is subject to change at any time, without notice. This fee is published via the Faast API and is available in real time before Offers are assigned on the Faast Network marketplace. Faast may collect API network access fees in accordance with agreements with downstream affiliates, which are included in said API network access fees. Network access fees vary depending on several factors including, but not limited to: the number of Makers on the Faast Network, if specific Offers are filled through a referral, the size and frequency of completed offers, and the blockchain network fees at the time of an offer. The Faast Network also requires Makers to maintain cryptocurrency in a Channel Address. The cryptocurrency in the Channel Address may be withdrawn by the maker on request, given that there are no active, or in progress offers on the Faast Network from the Maker. Faast may ensure quality of service though use of the provisions of “Dispute Resolution” outlined below.</p>
              <h5 className='font-weight-bold'>Dispute Resolution</h5>
              <p>If an Offer is determined to not have completed within the Payment Window, or if the Taker and the Maker are in a disagreement over an Offer, a dispute will be triggered by the Faast network, either automatically, or on request of one of the Parties. If and when they are allowed to do so by these Terms of Services, Disputes may be resolved by Faast support staff, or through an automated resolution system on the Faast network.
Faast may take the Takers side if any, but not limited to, of the following criteria have been met:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>The Maker has not broadcasted a payment within the Payment Window;</li>
                <li>The Maker is no longer communicating with the Faast Network API;</li>
                <li>The Maker has broadcasted a payment for an incorrect amount.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Which will lead to the following result: the Faast Network will and sign a transaction in which Cryptocurrency shall be transferred from the Payment Channel Address to the Taker.
Faast may take the Takers side, when any, but not limited to, of the following criteria have been met:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>A third party has frozen/stopped/held the payment made by Taker;</li>
                <li>Payment was not made by the Taker, or only a partial payment was made;</li>
                <li>A cryptocurrency network is experiencing a degradation of service wherein payment or delivery of cryptocurrency is not possible within the Payment Window</li>
              </ul>

              <h5 className='font-weight-bold'>Provisions specific to the Affiliate program</h5>
              <p>Hereinafter, the Faast Affiliate Program is called “Program” for short, and you, the affiliate, will be called “Affiliate” and the takers you refer will be called “Affiliate Taker”. Once you begin using the “Program”, you must be fully compliant with the Terms and Services to remain eligible for the Program.
You can begin using the “Program” pending account approval. If an Affiliate Taker has completed an Offer with a Maker on the Faast network, you may be eligible to an Affiliate Reward, based on certain conditions.
In order to be compensated, you request an Affiliate Payout via the Faast API, or Faast Affiliate Portal. Affiliate Rewards are subject to review to ensure these terms and conditions have been met. Pending affiliate payouts should not be considered guaranteed, and are subject to the provisions in this agreement.
When referring an Affiliate Taker, you will also be able to specify a specific Affiliate Rate you expect to receive in return for the referral. The maker who executes the Offer with the Affiliate Taker will take into account this Affiliate Rate when creating the Offer. If the Maker is successful in automated hedging of the offer, the full Affiliate Rate will be recorded as payable to the Affiliate. If the Maker is unable to properly hedge the offer, then an Affiliate Reward will be calculated based on the maximum possible amount without the Maker taking a loss on the offer.
If the Maker fails to remit Affiliate Rewards to the Faast network, the Maker will be removed from the Network, but outstanding Affiliate Rewards will not be honored.
Upon termination of the Program and/or any portion thereof, for any reason, or upon disqualification, termination, suspension of a Affiliate account for any reason, Affiliate ceases to receive Affiliate Rewards from any Offers, that his Affiliate Taker may complete hereinafter.
Faast reserves the right to immediately terminate any Affiliation or deny use of our API if:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>An Affiliate does not adequately integrate the Faast API into their service;</li>
                <li>An Affiliate engages in activity that Faast determines, in its sole discretion, to be against the collaborative spirit of the Program; or</li>
                <li>An Affiliate or its Takers fails to comply with the then-current general Terms of Service</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Additionally, Faast reserves the right to terminate any Taker or Affiliate’s use of the Service at any time for any reason or no reason, in Faast sole discretion.  Additionally, Faast may, without prior notice, suspend the Service, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the Service, to any Affiliate or to Taker generally; or create usage or Transaction limits for the Service. Faast may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend Affiliate access to the Service without notice and liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination Affiliate violates any provision of these Terms, or Faast may: (a) suspend, restrict, or terminate Affiliate access to any or all of the Services, and/or (b) deactivate or cancel an Affiliate if: (i) we are so required by a facially valid subpoena, court order, or binding order of a government authority; (ii) we reasonably suspect Affiliate of using the Service in connection with a Prohibited Activity; (iii) use of an Affiliate is subject to any pending litigation, investigation, or government proceeding and/or perceived heightened risk of legal or regulatory non-compliance associated with Affiliate or Affiliate Taker activity; (iv) Affiliate takes any action that Faast deems as circumventing Faast’s controls; (v) Faast decides, in its sole discretion, to suspend or terminate Affiliate access to the Service for any reason or no reason.
Upon termination for any reason or no reason, Affiliate continues to be bound by these Terms. Affiliate is solely responsible for its interactions with other Parties on the Faast Network. Faast reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor disputes between Affiliate Takers and Makers. You acknowledge that Faast’s decision to take certain actions, including limiting access to, suspending, or terminating an Affiliate, may be based on confidential criteria. You agree that Faast is under no obligation to disclose the details of its risk management, or security procedures to you.
5. Indemnity Affiliate agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Faast and its subsidiaries, agents, licensors, managers, and other affiliated companies, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees) arising from: (a) Affiliate’s use of and access to the Service, including any data or content transmitted or received by Affiliate; (b) Affiliate’s violation of any term of these Terms; (c) Affiliate’s violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any right of privacy or Intellectual Property Rights; (d) Affiliate’s violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation; or (e) Affiliate’s willful misconduct.

THIS MEANS, BY WAY OF EXAMPLE ONLY (AND WITHOUT LIMITING THE SCOPE OF THE PRECEDING SENTENCE), THAT IF YOU CLAIM THAT Faast FAILED TO PROCESS A BUY OR SELL TRANSACTION PROPERLY, YOUR DAMAGES ARE LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN THE VALUE OF THE SUPPORTED cryptocurrency AT ISSUE IN THE TRANSACTION, AND THAT YOU MAY NOT RECOVER FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITES, OR OTHER TYPES OF SPECIAL, INCIDENTIAL, INDIRECT, INTANGIBLE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF THE VALUE OF THE SUPPORTED cryptocurrency AT ISSUE IN THE TRANSACTION.SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.THE Faast SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY.TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, Faast SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND/OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.</p>

              <h5 className='font-weight-bold'>Arbitration</h5>
              <p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS.</p>

              <p>To expedite and control the cost of disputes, you and we agree that any legal or equitable claim arising out of or relating to your use of the Services or these Terms, including the formation, validity, enforceability, scope, or applicability of these Terms, will be resolved as follows: except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights (which may be brought in any competent court without the posting of a bond), any dispute arising under your use of the Services shall be finally settled on an individual basis through confidential, binding arbitration in accordance with the British Virgin Islands International Arbitration Centre's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes, available at www.bviiac.org, and you and Faast hereby expressly waive trial by jury. This means that all claims other than intellectual property lawsuits, such as copyright or trademark infringement lawsuits, or claims seeking non-monetary relief would be subject to binding arbitration. This includes claims which may pre-date this agreement. The arbitration shall take place in the British Virgin Islands, in the English language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the BVIIAC' rules.

We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial. If a court or federal regulator with oversight over Faast decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this section’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court, subject to your and Faast's right to appeal the court's decision. All other claims will be arbitrated.</p>
