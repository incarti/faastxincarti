            <p>
            Throughout this policy, we use the term &quot;personal information&quot; to
            describe information that can be associated with a specific person
            and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider
            personal information to include information that has been
            anonymized so that it does not identify a specific user.
            </p>
            <p>
            faast takes reasonable precautions, as described herein, to protect
            your information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure,
            alteration, and destruction. We may store, process and transmit
            information in locations around the world -- we may process your
            personal information on a server located outside the country
            you live. Some information may also be stored locally on devices
            you use to interact with faast’s Services.

            procedural safeguards. We use firewalls and data encryption,
            we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files,
            and we limit access to personal information only to those employees
            who need to know that information in order to process it for us.
